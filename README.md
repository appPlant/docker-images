# appplant/mruby-cli
Docker image to build mruby-cli based binaries against glibc-2.12 (or older), glibc-2.14 (or newer) and musl.

The public images can be found [here][repo] on Docker Hub.


## How to use

For cross-compilation against glibc-2.12:

    $ docker pull appplant/mruby-cli:glibc-2.12

To compile against glibc-2.14:

    $ docker pull appplant/mruby-cli:glibc-2.14

To compile against musl:

    $ docker pull appplant/mruby-cli:musl


## Development

A copy of an MacOSX SDK is required for the cross-build image _Dockerfile.glibc-2.14_.
The SDKs are available from [here][osx].

Build each docker image:

    $ docker build -f Dockerfile.[glibc-2.12|glibc-2.14|musl] -t appplant/mruby-cli:[glibc-2.12|glibc-2.14|musl] .

Open a shell to see if all works fine:

    $ docker run -ti appplant/mruby-cli:[glibc-2.12|glibc-2.14|musl] /bin/sh -l

Finally upload the images:

    $ docker push appplant/mruby-cli:[glibc-2.12|glibc-2.14|musl]

See the build tasks:

    $ rake -T
